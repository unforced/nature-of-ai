# Weekly Progress Report - August 2, 2024

## Summary

Significant progress on Phase 2 of the Nature of AI project. We've successfully implemented the core UI components and established a robust testing and documentation framework.

## Accomplishments This Week

### 1. Documentation System ✅
- Created comprehensive `/dev-docs/` structure
- Implemented `CLAUDE.md` for AI assistant context
- Documented architecture and component guidelines
- Established changelog and progress tracking

### 2. Testing Framework ✅
- Set up Playwright for E2E testing
- Created test suites for all major features
- Achieved 60/95 tests passing (63% pass rate)
- Identified areas needing responsive design fixes

### 3. Book Reader Interface ✅
- Implemented chapter navigation sidebar
- Created content display component
- Added responsive mobile navigation
- Integrated with mock chapter data

### 4. Interactive Code Blocks ✅
- Built syntax-highlighted code display
- Added copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Implemented "Run in playground" feature
- Integrated inline AI chat for code help

### 5. Code Playground ✅
- Integrated Monaco Editor for code editing
- Created p5.js preview with iframe sandbox
- Added run/stop controls
- Implemented console output capture
- Added code reset functionality

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Decisions
- Used dynamic imports for Monaco Editor to avoid SSR issues
- Implemented Zustand for playground state management
- Created modular component structure with clear separation
- Used iframe sandboxing for secure code execution

### Testing Insights
- Mobile responsiveness needs attention
- Some CSS selectors need updating for test stability
- Performance is good with sub-100ms page loads
- Editor loading takes ~2s (acceptable for initial load)

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Monaco Editor SSR**: Resolved with Next.js dynamic imports
2. **Test Flakiness**: Some tests fail due to timing issues
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile navigation needs refinement
4. **Content Loading**: Need to implement real content sync

## Next Week's Goals

### High Priority
1. Fix failing E2E tests (achieve 90%+ pass rate)
2. Implement real content sync from Nature of Code repo
3. Add Supabase integration for data persistence
4. Improve mobile responsive design

### Medium Priority
1. Add search functionality
2. Implement user authentication
3. Create sketch saving feature
4. Add performance monitoring

### Nice to Have
1. Dark mode improvements
2. Keyboard shortcuts for playground
3. Export sketch functionality
4. Social sharing features

## Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Not yet measured (todo)
- **E2E Test Pass Rate**: 63% (60/95)
- **Page Load Performance**: <100ms (after initial load)
- **Bundle Size**: ~750 modules (needs optimization)

## Team Notes

The project is progressing well with solid foundations in place. The modular architecture is paying off, making it easy to add new features. The documentation-first approach has been particularly helpful for maintaining coherency.

## Action Items

1. [ ] Run full test suite and fix failures
2. [ ] Update responsive breakpoints
3. [ ] Implement content sync workflow
4. [ ] Add error boundaries for better stability
5. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
